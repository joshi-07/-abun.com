# TODO: Add Unsplash Photos and Minor Animations to ABUN Landing Page

## Tasks
- [x] Add Unsplash images to the two sample cards in the #samples section (index.html)
  - Blog Intro — UX Design: Use a relevant image (e.g., UX design workspace)
  - Product Description — Wireless Headphones: Use a relevant image (e.g., tech headphones)
- [x] Add minor hover animations to the sample cards using GSAP (script.js) for a subtle popup effect (e.g., scale on hover)
- [x] Test the changes by running the page locally to ensure images load and animations work

## Notes
- Images should use the existing .card-img class for consistency.
- Animations should be minor and enhance user experience without being distracting.
- Theme: Dark purple, professional, AI content writing.
